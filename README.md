# public-api-requests

This application was made to display knowledge of fetch, working with JSON files, promises, etc. 

The program generates 12 user cards based on data fetched from a user API. The JSON data is used to create the different users and their information. When you click on a user a module window is created to display more information on the user. When you click the 'X' the module is closed and the module elements are removed. 

Running the index.html file should open up the application in the web browser.
